# bunyan-stackdriver

Bunyan stream for StackDriver (Google Cloud Logging API) integration.

**:exclamation: Google Cloud now has an official Bunyan logging transport that should be preferred over this library: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node/tree/master/packages/logging-bunyan**

## Installation

Install bunyan and bunyan-stackdriver...

```bash
npm install bunyan bunyan-stackdriver
```

## Setup

1. Enable [Google Cloud Logging API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/logging.googleapis.com/overview)
in your Google Developer Console.
1. Start using `bunyan-stackdriver` to create log your messages

## Basic usage

```javascript
var bunyan  = require("bunyan"),
    BunyanStackDriver = require("bunyan-stackdriver"),
    log;

log = bunyan.createLogger({
    name: "myApp",
    streams: [{
      type: "raw", // faster; makes Bunyan send objects instead of stringifying messages
      stream: new BunyanStackDriver({
        projectId: "your_project_id"
      })
    }],
    level: "error"
});

log.error("hello bunyan user");
```

## Full options

```javascript
new BunyanStackDriver({
  // The path to your key file:
  keyFilename: "/path/to/keyfile.json",
  // Or the contents of the key file:
  credentials: require('./path/to/keyfile.json'),
  logName: "logname",
  projectId: "project-id",
  writeInterval: 500, // ms
  resource: {
    type: "resource_type",
    labels: {key1: value1}
  }
}, function errorCallback(err) { console.log(err); });
```

* If you are running on Google Cloud Platform, authentication will be taken
care of automatically. If you're running elsewhere, or wish to provide
alternative authentication, you can specify the `keyFilename` pointing to a
service account JSON key.

* logName. Must be less than 512 characters and include only alphanumeric
characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen and period.

* projectId. The id of the project. This can be omitted if the environment
variable "GCLOUD_PROJECT" is set.

* writeInterval. Specifies the maximum write frequency. Messages will be
batched between writes to avoid exceeding API rate limits. (The default GCP
limit is 20 RPS. The default setting for BunyanStackDriver is 500 ms.)

* resource. See https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/ref_v2beta1/rest/v2beta1/MonitoredResource.

* errorCallback. Will report errors during the logging process itself.

## Stackdriver Error Reporting

When errors with stack traces are logged - `bunyan.error(new Error('message'))` - these can automatically be captured by the [Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/) interface in Google Cloud Platform. To do so some additional configuration is required as per [Stackdriver Formatting Error Messages](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/docs/formatting-error-messages)

When logging, a _service context_ is required. This can be added on a per log basis or configured for all logs during logger creation like so:

```
const logger = bunyan.createLogger({
    name: 'Example',
    serializers: ...
    streams: ...,
    serviceContext: {
        service: 'example',
        version: 'x.x.x'
    }
});
```
